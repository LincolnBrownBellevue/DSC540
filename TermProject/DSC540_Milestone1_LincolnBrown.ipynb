This should help me establish a baseline that I can then use to compare whether or not there is a difference in the number of crimes that occur on a full moon or not.

I also want to be sure that I point out that I used Chicago because the dataset was available. I am grateful that the City of Chicago makes this data publicly available for research. I may also subset the data to look at violent crime versus other types of crime because I think it would be interesting to see if there are any patterns there. \n",

I also investigated other cities crime statistics as potential sources for more data, but I was unable to find comparable datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "One area that might prove challenging is dividing the types of crime into violent and nonviolent categories. Another area that I presume will take some work is getting all of the weather data into one dataframe. While it is certainly doable, it will take some time to get it all sorted out and loaded. I also will have quite a few NaN values to deal with in my flat file and API datasets. Handling those will likely lead to dropping some columns and substituting my own values in. \n",
